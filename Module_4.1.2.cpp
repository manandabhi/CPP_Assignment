Q. What is OOP? List OOP concepts.

A. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
   which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

List OOP concepts.
1. Class and object
==>CLASS :
	definition:
		data-members and member-functions are bind together in a single unit
		and that single unit is called a class.
Object: everything in the world is an Object.
==> object is an istance of a class.

2. Encapsulation:
==>encapsulation is a process of wrapping similar code in one place.
 	In C++, we can bundle data members and functions that operate together inside a single class.

3. Inheritance :-
==>used to access properties(member-functions,data-members) of 
		one class to another class
	type:-1. Single Inheritance
	      2. Multiple 
              3. Multilevel
	      4. Hierarchical 
   	      5. Hybrid
	


4. Polymorphism:-
==>Polymorphism:- one name multiple forms

==> one op and multiple ways to use
	Types:
	
	1. Compile Time / Early Binding / Static
	2. Run Time / Late Binding / Dynamic
	
	=> function overloading
	==>same name but different parameters
	
	
	
	=> function overriding
		==>same name and same parameters
		===> Only works with inheritance

5. Abstraction
